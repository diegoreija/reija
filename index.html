                "Efficiency and perfection. Every line of code, every decision,
                every project I undertake follows this premise. I don't seek to
                do enough, but the best"
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                My approach has always been clear: optimize, polish, refine. 
                I am not a conformist. The idea of ​​leaving something half-done
                is as foreign to me as it is unacceptable. Every day is an
                opportunity to improve, to learn something new, to challenge 
                my own limits. Being good at something is not enough; my goal
                is to be the best.

            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                Perfectionism has been both my driving force and my challenge.
                It drives me to reach levels of precision and excellence, but
                it also forces me to know how and when to stop. Over time, I 
                have learned that true mastery is not only in flawless execution,
                but in the ability to evolve without getting caught up in obsession
                with detail.

            <p class="description_about_text">
                Technology was not a choice; it was a natural path. 
                Since I was a child, my curiosity led me to explore 
                the hidden codes of video games, to discover vulnerabilities 
                in systems and to understand that, in this digital world, 
                everything is moldable.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                My first formal steps in computing began with the intermediate
                degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks. It was in that 
                environment that I discovered cybersecurity and its infinite 
                complexity. What others saw as a set of rules, I understood as 
                a constant challenge, a game of strategy where every decision 
                counts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                Currently, I am on the path to the advanced cycle of Network 
                Computer Systems Administration, with the goal of specializing 
                in Cybersecurity. 
                It is not just a degree, it is a commitment to a career that demands 
                adaptability, creativity and, above all, a hacker mentality – in the 
                purest sense of the term: question, understand and improve.

            <p class="description_about_text">
                What got me hooked on this field was not the idea of ​​protecting systems, 
                but the fact that we are never really safe. There is always a vulnerability, 
                a backdoor, a human oversight that can be exploited. That makes this world 
                so challenging and fascinating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                I have worked with HTB machines, explored tools on GitHub, and learned that 
                the best way to understand security is to think like an attacker. 
                Every system, every network, every application has its Achilles heel. 
                Identifying it before someone with malicious intent does is what makes the 
                difference.

            <br>
            <p class="description_about_text">
                My goal is to master this field. Not just be competent, but become a reference. 
                Not by public recognition, but by the professional respect of those who 
                understand the true depth of this world.

                In five years, I see myself consolidated in cybersecurity, accumulating 
                certifications such as CompTIA Pentest+, OSCP, GCFA and many more. I 
                imagine myself working in a multinational or in a government agency, 
                leading teams, developing strategies and making a difference in the 
                protection of data and systems.

                each challenge overcome is one more step towards my goal: to be the

                Respect, commitment, excellence. In a work team, the essential thing
